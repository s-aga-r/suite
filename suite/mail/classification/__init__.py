"""Sorting incoming mail into categories: Primary, Promotions, Social, Updates and Forums.

A message is classified when it is first pulled from the JMAP server, and its category is kept
there as a keyword (see `Category.keyword`). The keyword is the record of the work: a message that
carries one is not classified again, whichever site or device fetches it next.

A sender somebody has a rule for is asked first (see `rules`): what a user or an admin has said
about a sender outranks anything worked out from a message. Classification is layered after that,
cheapest first, and each layer names a category or passes the message on:

1. `headers` - what the message's headers say about how it was sent.
2. (planned) a locally trained heuristic classifier.
3. (planned) a model.

A message no layer claims is Primary.
