"""Layer 1: what a message's headers say about how it was sent.

Headers tell bulk and automated mail from mail a person wrote, and a discussion list from a
campaign. They do not read the message, so mail without any such header is passed on rather than
guessed at.

Who a message is from is not asked here beyond the kind of address it is ("noreply", "billing"):
which senders are social networks, say, is a matter of sender rules (see `rules`), which a site
can add to.
